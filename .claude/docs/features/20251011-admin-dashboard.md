## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

**Statistics Aggregation:**
- All statistics calculated in a single endpoint for efficiency
- Uses raw queries and aggregations for optimal performance
- Includes computed metrics (revenue totals, monthly breakdowns)
- Returns structured data with nested arrays for different stat categories

**Real-time Data:**
- Dashboard stats load on mount
- No caching implemented (shows real-time data)
- Loading states for better UX during data fetch

**Visual Design:**
- Color-coded cards for different metric types
- Icon-based visual indicators for quick recognition
- Gradient backgrounds for revenue/user cards
- Responsive grid layout adapting to screen sizes

### Key Implementation Notes

**Product Statistics:**
- Total products count
- Active vs inactive products
- Featured products count
- Low stock alerts (stock <= min_stock_level)
- Out of stock products
- All statistics queryable independently

**Order Statistics:**
- Total orders across all statuses
- Breakdown by status (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Revenue calculations excluding cancelled/refunded orders
- Monthly revenue for current month only

**Recent Products List:**
- Last 10 products ordered by creation date
- Includes product images, category, price, stock status
- Color-coded stock indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Quick navigation to full product management

**Low Stock Alerts:**
- Only shows active products
- Filters products where stock <= min_stock_level
- Sorted by stock quantity (lowest first)
- Red-themed alert table for visibility
- Limited to 10 most critical items

**User Statistics:**
- Total user count
- New users this month
- Can be extended for more detailed user analytics
