- `backend/routes/api.php` - Added admin routes for product management and image upload routes with named route groups

### Frontend

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/views/admin/ProductImagesView.vue` - Interface for managing product images with upload, delete, and set primary functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/views/admin/ProductsView.vue` - Built complete product management interface with table view, create/edit modal, search and filter functionality
- `frontend/src/views/HomeView.vue` - Added featured product display with images, pricing, and add to cart functionality
- `frontend/src/services/productService.js` - Added admin product endpoints and image management endpoints
- `frontend/src/router/index.js` - Added route for product image management page

### Database

**Migrations:**

---

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

**Separate Image Model:**
Per task requirements, created a separate ProductImage model instead of storing images as JSON in the products table. This provides:
- Better data normalization
- Easier image manipulation (ordering, primary selection)
- Improved query performance for images
- Cascade deletion when products are deleted

**Image Storage:**
- Images stored in `storage/public/products/` directory
- Filenames use timestamp + unique ID to prevent conflicts
- Alt text support for accessibility
- Sort order for controlling display sequence
- Primary image flag for featured display

**API Resources:**
Implemented Laravel API Resources for consistent response format:
- Includes computed properties (effective_price, is_on_sale, is_in_stock, is_low_stock)
- Eager loads relationships to prevent N+1 queries
- Conditional loading using whenLoaded()

**Form Requests:**
Separated validation into dedicated Form Request classes following Laravel best practices:
- StoreProductRequest for creation with strict validation
- UpdateProductRequest for updates with 'sometimes' rules
- Unique SKU validation accounting for current product in updates

### Key Implementation Notes

**Admin vs Public Routes:**
- Public product endpoints filter to only active products
- Admin endpoints include inactive products
- Route naming with `admin.` prefix enables conditional logic in controllers

**Image Management:**
- Only one primary image allowed per product
- Setting a new primary image automatically removes flag from others
- Images auto-increment sort_order based on existing max
- Image deletion removes file from storage and database record

**Frontend Features:**
- Search products by name, SKU, or description
- Filter by category
- Stock level indicators (green/yellow/red based on min_stock_level)
- Modal-based product create/edit form
- Separate dedicated page for image management
- Featured products on home page with sale price display

### Dependencies Added/Updated

**Backend:**
- No new dependencies (uses built-in Laravel features)

**Frontend:**
- No new dependencies (uses existing Vue 3, Vue Router, Pinia setup)

---

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Backend:** Comprehensive feature tests created (requires SQLite PDO extension to run)
- **Frontend:** Component-level testing structure in place

### Test Files
- `backend/tests/Feature/ProductControllerTest.php` - 14 tests covering all CRUD operations, filtering, search, and authorization
- `backend/tests/Feature/ProductImageControllerTest.php` - 13 tests covering image upload, update, delete, sorting, and validation

### Test Scenarios Covered

**ProductController:**
- Guest can view active products
- Guest can view single active product
- Guest cannot view inactive products
- Admin can view all products (including inactive)
- Filter by category, featured status, stock status
- Search by name/description
- CRUD operations with proper authorization
- Validation of required fields
- Automatic slug generation from name
- API resource structure validation

**ProductImageController:**
- Get product images sorted by sort_order
- Upload images with validation (file type, size)
- Set primary image with automatic flag removal from others
- Update image details (alt text, sort order, primary status)
- Delete images with file cleanup from storage
- Prevent cross-product image manipulation
- Authorization checks for non-admin users
- Auto-increment sort order on upload

## API Changes

### New Endpoints

**Product Management (Admin):**
```
GET    /api/admin/products              - List all products (including inactive)
GET    /api/admin/products/{product}    - Get single product
POST   /api/admin/products              - Create product
PUT    /api/admin/products/{product}    - Update product
DELETE /api/admin/products/{product}    - Delete product
```

**Product Image Management (Admin):**
```
GET    /api/admin/products/{product}/images           - Get product images
POST   /api/admin/products/{product}/images           - Upload image
PUT    /api/admin/products/{product}/images/{image}   - Update image details
DELETE /api/admin/products/{product}/images/{image}   - Delete image
```

### Updated Endpoints
```
GET    /api/products                    - Now uses ProductResource, eager loads images
GET    /api/products/{product}          - Now uses ProductResource, includes images
```

### Breaking Changes
- Product API responses now use API Resources format (wrapped in `data` key)
- Response structure includes additional computed fields (is_on_sale, is_in_stock, etc.)

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. Uses existing Laravel storage configuration.

---

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
- Create storage symlink: `php artisan storage:link`
- Ensure `storage/app/public/products` directory is writable

### Post-Deployment Steps
1. Verify product endpoints return correct data
2. Test image upload functionality
3. Check file permissions on storage directory
4. Verify images display correctly on frontend

### Future Improvements
- **WYSIWYG Editor:** Integrate rich text editor (TinyMCE or Quill) for product description field
- **Bulk Upload:** Add ability to upload multiple images at once
- **Image Optimization:** Implement automatic image resizing and optimization
- **Drag & Drop Reordering:** Add drag-and-drop interface for image sort order
- **Product Variants:** Add support for product variants (size, color, etc.)

## Rollback Plan

In case this needs to be reverted:
1. Revert migration: `php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1`
2. Remove image upload routes from `backend/routes/api.php`
3. Restore original ProductController code
4. Delete created files listed above
5. Clear route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
6. Clear view cache: `php artisan view:clear`
